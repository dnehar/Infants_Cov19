## Goal of the study: 
1. Explore the immune alterations upon SARS-CoV-2 infection in two month-old hospitalized infants. <br/>
2. Compare immune alterations in infants with those previously observed in **infants and children** with moderate COVID-19 (Wimmers et al. [PMID:37776858]; mutiome dataset [GSE239799]).<br/>
3. Compare immune alterations in infants with those previously observed in **adults** with COVID-19 (Liu et al.; [PMID:33713619]; scRNAseq dataset [GSE161918]). <br/>

Conducting research of this kind in 2 month-old infants is challenging, particularly due to the limited blood volume available (< 2 ml). While the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in both adults and children is fairely well characterized, cases of **hospitalized** infants with **severe disease** remain rare. <br/>

## Cohort information (scRNAseq):
-> 26 SARS-Cov-2 infected infants: 10 subacute (Group1, G1), 11 moderate (G2) and 5 severe (G3) patients.<br/>
-> 14 healthy matched controls (pHC).<br/>
-> Age: pediatric COVID-19 (pCoV) : median, IQR age: 1.63 [0.93-7.59] months | Healthy controls:   median IQR age: 2.01 [1.86-4.28] months.<br/>
