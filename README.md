# Infants/young children with COVID-19
Pediatric COVID-19 project

# Cohort details 
-> 26 SARS-Cov-2 infected infants (10 asymptomatic, 11 mild and 5 severe patients)

-> 14 healthy matched controls

-> Age: pediatric COVID-19 (pCoV) : median, IQR age: 1.63 [0.93-7.59] months | Healthy controls:   median IQR age: 2.01 [1.86-4.28] months


# Study design for scRNAseq
scRNA-seq profiling of PBMC from 26 SARS-Cov-2 infected infants/young children (10 asymptomatic, 11 mild and 5 severe patients), as well as 14 healthy matched controls
Antibody titers (anti-SARS and IFN)

# Data availability 
Raw counts (cell ranger outputs) and processed data (.h5ad objects) are publicly available: GSE206289. 
Fastq files will be available on dbGAP (phs002655.v1.p1) upon acceptance.
