## Pediatric COVID-19 (pCoV) project: 
SARS-CoV-2 infected two-month-old infants with different disease severity.<br/>  

## Goal of the study: 
1. Explore the immune alterations upon SARS-CoV-2 infection in two months old infants. <br/>
2. Compare immune alterations in infants with those observed in **young children** with COVID-19 (Wimmers et al PMID: 37776858; GSE239799).<br/>
3. Compare immune alterations in infants with those observed in **adults** with COVID-19 (Liu et al.; PMID: 33713619; GSE161918). <br/>

## Cohort information (scRNAseq):
-> 26 SARS-Cov-2 infected infants: 10 subacute (Group1, G1), 11 moderate (G2) and 5 severe (G3) patients.<br/>
-> 14 healthy matched controls (pHC).<br/>
-> Age: pediatric COVID-19 (pCoV) : median, IQR age: 1.63 [0.93-7.59] months | Healthy controls:   median IQR age: 2.01 [1.86-4.28] months.<br/>
