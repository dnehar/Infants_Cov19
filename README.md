## Goal of the study (data available here: GSE206289): 

1. Explore the immune alterations upon SARS-CoV-2 infection in two months old infants
2. Compare immune alterations in infants with those observed in adults with COVID-19 (Liu et al.; PMID: 33713619; GSE161918)
3. Compare immune alterations in infants with those observed in children with COVID (Wimmers et al PMID: 37776858; GSE239799)

## Infants/young children with COVID-19: 
Pediatric COVID-19 (pCoV) project

## Cohort information:

-> 26 SARS-Cov-2 infected infants: 10 subacute (G1), 11 moderate (G2) and 5 severe (G3) patients 
-> 14 healthy matched controls
-> Age: pediatric COVID-19 (pCoV) : median, IQR age: 1.63 [0.93-7.59] months | Healthy controls:   median IQR age: 2.01 [1.86-4.28] months


## Study design for scRNAseq
scRNA-seq profiling of PBMC from 26 SARS-Cov-2 infected infants/young children (10 asymptomatic, 11 mild and 5 severe patients), as well as 14 healthy matched controls

## Data availability 

Raw counts (cell ranger outputs) and processed data (.h5ad objects used in the notebooks) are publicly available: GSE206289. 
Fastq files will be available on dbGAP (phs002655.v1.p1) upon acceptance.
