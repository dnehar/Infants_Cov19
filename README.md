## Goal of the study (data available here: GSE206289): 

1. Explore the immune alterations upon SARS-CoV-2 infection in infants during first months of life
2. Compare immune alterations in infants and adults with COVID-19 (GSE161918)

## Infants/young children with COVID-19: 
Pediatric COVID-19 (pCoV) project

## Cohort details: 
-> 26 SARS-Cov-2 infected infants (10 subacute, 11 mild and 5 severe patients)

-> 14 healthy matched controls

-> Age: pediatric COVID-19 (pCoV) : median, IQR age: 1.63 [0.93-7.59] months | Healthy controls:   median IQR age: 2.01 [1.86-4.28] months


## Study design for scRNAseq
scRNA-seq profiling of PBMC from 26 SARS-Cov-2 infected infants/young children (10 asymptomatic, 11 mild and 5 severe patients), as well as 14 healthy matched controls
Antibody titers (anti-SARS and IFN)

## Data availability 

Raw counts (cell ranger outputs) and processed data (.h5ad objects used in the notebooks) are publicly available: GSE206289. 
Fastq files will be available on dbGAP (phs002655.v1.p1) upon acceptance.

## scRNAseq chemistry  
10X Genomics V3 chemistry

## Other measurments 
1- Serum analyte quantitation using Olink (92 Analytes) and ELISA kits (Biolegend) focused on inflammatory and interferon pathways
2- Antibody titers (anti-SARS-CoV-2: Spike, S2 and RBD and anti-IFN)
