# Infants/young children with COVID-19
Padiatric COVID-19 project

Cohort: 
26 SARS-Cov-2 infected infants (10 asymptomatic, 11 mild and 5 severe patients)
14 healthy matched controls


# Study design for scRNAseq
scRNA-seq profiling of PBMC from 26 SARS-Cov-2 infected infants (10 asymptomatic, 11 mild and 5 severe patients), as well as 14 healthy matched controls
Antibody titers (anti-SARS and IFN)
